## Experience in deploying IoT technologies for elderly friendly Smart Cities.

Many city-dwelling elderly people can be greatly affected after a minor change in their living or health conditions. Also, nutrition and pollution became a major factor of health across the world. Metabolic diseases, quality of life (impairments) and respiratory disease are among the most common risks. Through the new wave of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart City systems, it is now possible to help individuals capture and make use of their personal data in a way that will help them maintain healthy and independent for longer.

How do we keep our elders safe and well within the community? 

Three general parameters have been selected for observation, each one related to different activities detection:
- Socialization: place of interest visits, senior activity centre visits frequency, activities attended
- Mobility: physical activity, going-out frequency and going-out length
- Activity of Daily Living: meals frequency, sleep activity, vital signs

Different set of technology are deployed to fit better with the elderly needs and challenges:
- Indoor monitoring for the more frail ones (and/or homebound): motion sensors for each living space, contact sensors for smart objects, sleep mat with vital signs monitoring features)
- Outdoor Monitoring for the more active one: lifestyle using wearable Internet-of-Things technology
